    <h1 style="color: green">INDIAN ARMY</h1>
    <p>The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component
     of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,
     and its professional head is the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers
     have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial
     position of great honour. The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company,
     which eventually became the British Indian Army, and the armies of the princely states, which were
     merged into the national army after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse
     histories and have participated in a number of battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and
     theatre honours before and after Independence. </p>
